A comprehensive, automated security scanning tool designed to perform vulnerability assessments, port scanning, network reconnaissance, and security audits. This tool provides detailed reports and visualizations to help identify and address security vulnerabilities.

## üìã Features

- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports and running services on target systems
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Detect common security vulnerabilities in target systems
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Map network topology and discover devices
- **Security Configuration Audit**: Evaluate security settings against best practices
- **Customizable Scanning Profiles**: Configure scans based on specific requirements
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports in multiple formats
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize scan results with charts and graphs
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Run on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanJ24/AI-Powered-Recon-Bot.git
cd AI-Powered-Recon-Bot
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Scan

Run a basic scan against a target:

```bash
python scanner.py --target example.com
```

### Advanced Scan with Options

```bash
python scanner.py --target example.com --ports 1-1000 --thorough --output report.json
```

### Continuous Monitoring

Set up automated scanning at regular intervals:

```bash
python scanner.py --target example.com --monitor --interval 24h
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Configuration File

The scanner uses `scan_config.json` for default settings. You can modify this file to customize scan parameters:

```json
{
  "default_ports": "1-1024",
  "timeout": 5,
  "threads": 10,
  "output_format": "json",
  "detailed_report": true
}
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--target` | Target to scan (IP or domain) | None (Required) |
| `--ports` | Port range to scan | 1-1024 |
| `--timeout` | Connection timeout in seconds | 5 |
| `--threads` | Number of concurrent threads | 10 |
| `--output` | Output file for results | None (stdout) |
| `--format` | Output format (json, csv, text) | json |
| `--thorough` | Perform thorough scanning | False |
| `--quiet` | Suppress output | False |
| `--monitor` | Enable continuous monitoring | False |
| `--interval` | Monitoring interval (in hours) | 24 |

## üìä Data Visualization

The tool includes data visualization capabilities to help interpret scan results. Example visualizations include:

- Port distribution charts
- Vulnerability severity graphs
- Network topology maps
- Time-based security trend analysis

An example port distribution chart is included in the repository as `ports_chart.png`.

## üîí Security Considerations

- Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any targets
- Some scanning techniques may trigger security systems or firewalls
- This tool should be used for legitimate security assessment purposes only
